// Part-barrel — the objective-49 /oauth/native/* no-redirect ceremony client.
//
// It is exported from lib/eden_platform.dart. Add exports for that area's
// files HERE, never to lib/eden_platform.dart: parallel work would
// clobber each other's edits to the shared umbrella barrel.
// (This part-barrel previously hung off lib/aoid.dart, which was
// folded into lib/eden_platform.dart and deleted. The collision-avoidance
// reason for these seven files is unchanged.)
//
// Riverpod is ALLOWED here. It was forbidden while lib/aoid.dart had to
// stay importable by a riverpod-3 consumer across a version boundary; that
// boundary is gone, and both the barrel and the closure-walking gate that
// enforced it were deleted with it.
// See doc/riverpod-3-migration.md §3.12.
